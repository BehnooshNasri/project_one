1,All counts are randomly rounded to a multiple of 3 using the following procedure: counts which are already a multiple of 3 are not adjusted; counts one greater than a multiple of 3 are adjusted to the next lowest multiple of 3 with a probability of two-thirds and to the next highest multiple of 3 with a probability of one-third. The probabilities are reversed for counts that are one less than a multiple of 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,The data are subject to revision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Enrolments are based on students enrolled in the postsecondary institutions at the time of the fall snapshot date, that is, a single date chosen by the institution which falls from September 30th to December 1st. Therefore students who are not enrolled during this time period are excluded and enrolment totals do not represent a full academic year. This has a greater impact on colleges as they have a continuous intake of students and shorter programs. It should also be noted, enrolments are based on program counts and not student counts. If a student is enrolled in more than one program as of the snapshot date, then all of their programs are included in the count.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Totals may not add up to the sum of all categories due to rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"This table uses the variant of the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Canada 2016 <a href=https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=1287672"" rel=""external noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Cannabis STEM and BHASE groupings (opens new window)</a> . This standard classifies fields of study into STEM (science", technology, engineering, and mathematics and computer sciences) and BHASE (business, humanities, health, arts, social science and education) categories. BHASE also includes fields in legal studies, trades, services, natural resources and conservation. Prior to 2008/2009, institutions provided an aggregated CIP code for field of study. Beginning in 2008/2009, Statistics Canada started coding field of study to the detailed CIP series but it was not until 2010/2011 that this was done uniformly across all institutions. This may cause light inconsistencies at the more detailed series of CIP, used to derive the STEM/BHASE groupings. Therefore, prior to 2010/2011," the STEM/BHASE groupings are not available in the public data tables.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,"Beginning with the 2015/2016 reference year, data for Ontario colleges were submitted by the Ontario Ministry of Colleges and Universities (MCU) to provide more consistent data reporting across the province. This results in a break in series for Ontario colleges between 2014/2015 and 2015/2016. Additionally, with the release of data for the PSIS 2017/2018 reference year, previously imputed data for Ontario colleges for the reference years 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 were replaced with real data submitted by the Ontario Ministry of Colleges and Universities (MCU).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
