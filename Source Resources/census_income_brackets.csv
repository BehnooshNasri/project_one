Footnotes:,,,,
1,"Historical comparison of geographic areas  The boundaries and names of census geographies can change from one census to the next. In order to facilitate data comparisons between censuses, previous census data have been adjusted to reflect as closely as possible the 2021 boundaries of these areas. The methodology used for this adjustment involved spatially linking blocks of previous censuses (concordance to the 1996 Census used the 1996 enumeration areas to the 2021 boundaries). A previous census block was linked to the 2021 area within which its representative point fell. A limited number of interactive linkages were completed to further enhance the adjustment in certain areas. For some census geographies, it was not possible to reflect the 2021 boundaries. The 2021 boundaries may not be reflected as there was no previous census block to assign to the 2021 area. As well previous census data for some 2021 areas may not be available due to the fact that the concordance did not produce an accurate representation of the 2021 area.",,,
2,Census family structureCensus family structure refers to the combination of relatives that comprise a census family. Classification on this variable considers the presence or absence of: married spouses or common-law partners and children.,,,
3,Family size    'Family size' refers to the number of persons in the family.,,,
4,"Earner or employment income recipient  Person with employment income during the reference period. Employment income can be in the form of wages, salaries and commissions or net self-employment income.  For the 2021 Census, the reference period is the calendar year 2020 for all income variables.  ",,,
5,"Total income  Total income refers to the sum of certain incomes (in cash and, in some circumstances, in kind) of the statistical unit during a specified reference period. The components used to calculate total income vary between:  – Statistical units of social statistical programs such as persons, private households, census families and economic families;  – Statistical units of business statistical programs such as enterprises, companies, establishments and locations; and  – Statistical units of farm statistical programs such as farm operator and farm family.  In the context of persons, total income refers to receipts from certain sources, before income taxes and deductions, during a specified reference period.  In the context of census families, total income refers to receipts from certain sources of all of its family members, before income taxes and deductions, during a specified reference period.  In the context of economic families, total income refers to receipts from certain sources of all of its family members, before income taxes and deductions, during a specified reference period.  In the context of households, total income refers to receipts from certain sources of all household members, before income taxes and deductions, during a specified reference period.  The monetary receipts included are those that tend to be of a regular and recurring nature. Receipts that are included as income are:  employment income from wages, salaries, tips, commissions and net income from self-employment (for both unincorporated farm and non-farm activities);  income from investment sources, such as dividends and interest on bonds, accounts, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and mutual funds;  income from employer and personal pension sources, such as private pensions and payments from annuities and registered retirement income funds (RRIFs);  other regular cash income, such as child support payments received, spousal support payments (alimony) received and scholarships;  income from government sources, such as social assistance, child benefits, Employment Insurance benefits, Old Age Security benefits, COVID-19 benefits and Canada Pension Plan and Québec Pension Plan benefits and disability income.  Receipts excluded from this income definition are:  one-time receipts, such as lottery winnings, gambling winnings, cash inheritances, lump-sum insurance settlements and tax-free savings account (TFSA) or registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) withdrawals;  capital gains because they are not by their nature regular and recurring. It is further assumed that they are more relevant to the concept of wealth than the concept of income;  employers' contributions to registered pension plans, Canada Pension Plan, Québec Pension Plan and Employment Insurance;  voluntary inter-household transfers, imputed rent, goods and services produced for barter and goods produced for own consumption.  For the 2021 Census, the reference period for income data is the calendar year 2020, unless otherwise specified.",,,
6,"The median income of a specified group is the amount that divides the income distribution of that group into two halves, i.e., the incomes of half of the units in that group are below the median, while those of the other half are above the median. Median incomes of families are calculated for all units, whether or not they had income.",,,
