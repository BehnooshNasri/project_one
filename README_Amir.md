# project_one


We aim to answer two questions: \
1- What is the effect of country of citizenship on enrolment in grad school(masters or docorate or equivilant)? What countries have the highest number of enrolment? \
2- What provinces have a higher number of individuals with grad school degrees? \
\
The Data:\
\
"clean_provincial_data.csv" is cleaned data with each province's population that have grad degrees. This should be used for answering question 1. \
"cleaned_gradschool_enrolment_international_student" is cleaned data with each country's population in canada that are/have enrolled in grad school.\


Also:

3: We aim to compare provinces of Ontario, BC,Alberta, and Quebec to eachother based on the counts of their population with a grad-degree and their income.

The Data:
'Grad_Canada_Data.csv' is cleaned data with each province's population degree data (focused on grad school).
