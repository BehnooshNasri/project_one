# Project One - Dream Team!

## Description of the Project
This project talks about what are some factors that can affect enrollment and graduation from post-graduate programs in Canada and around the world. 

Total Income;
Gender;
Geographic Location

### The analysis we're going to do is:

1. Get data from different resources including StatCanada and Census
2. Cleaning the data and converting into dataframes
3. Merge different data frames to start analyzing
4. Analyze the data from different variables (income, gender, geographic location, etc.) to perform linear regression to find correlations
5. Anaylze the final data and prepare the presentation

### The questions we're going to answer are:

1. What is the correlation between household income and post-grad degrees in select provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec?
2. What is the difference graduation rates for the same select provices?
3. What are the ratios between male and female graduates for post-grad studies in the select provinces?
4. which province has the highest number of post-grad graduates?
5. What are the countries with most international students enrolled in post-grad studies in Canada?
6. Using API, for abvialable data globally what are the post-grad statistics compared to the countries GDP?
7. Using API, for abvialable data globally what are the post-grad statistics compared to the countries population?
