## Description of the Project 

This project talks about what are some factors that can affect enrollment and graduation from post-graduate programs Canada

1. Total Income;
2. Gender;
3. Geographic Location


The analysis we're going to do is: 

1. Get data from StatCanada
2. Cleaning the data and converting into dataframes
3. Merge different data frames to start analyzing
2. Analyze the data from different variables (income, gender, geographic location, etc.) to perform linear regression to find correlations
3. Anaylze the final data and prepare the presentation

The questions we're going to answer are: 

1. Does total income of a person/household affect going to post-grad school? 
2. Does a person's gender has any effect on their enrollment/graduation? 
3. Does a person's geographic location (if in Canada, which Province; if international, which country) have any effect on enrollment/graduation?
4. What percentage of undergaduates apply to graduate school?
5. Does tution fees affect enrollment?
6. Compared to other countries with similar population and gdp how is Canada faring in education metrics (available data)?
